# 1. Introduction

This notebook walks through the process of accessing the Connectivity Map (1) - a dataset with transcriptional responses to chemical, genetic and disease perturbation in cell lines - and using its data to analyze drug response effects on genes involved with immunomodulation of cancer in cell lines. 


Besides this introduction section, this notebook also has one section explaining data manipulation steps and a section with a use case. The use case involves the analysis of the 65 immunomodulator genes present in the Connectivity Map dataset, in experiments involving drugs and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. 
 

## Gene Expression Data - the Connectivity Map

The Connectivity Map (CMap) dataset is available for download at [GSE92742](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE92742).

The files needed in this project are:

`GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_sig_info.txt`

`GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_sig_metrics.txt.gz`

`GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_cell_info.txt`

`GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_gene_info.txt.gz`

`GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_gene_info_delta_landmark.txt.gz`

`GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_pert_info.txt`

`GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_pert_metrics.txt.gz`

`GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_inst_info.txt.gz`

`GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_Level5_COMPZ.MODZ_n473647x12328.gctx`



The file `GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_Level5_COMPZ.MODZ_n473647x12328.gctx` contains the gene expression values of the 12,328 genes measured in the Connectivity Map dataset across 473,647 different experiments (1). The gene expression profile for each experiment is called a signature, and is the response of cells from one cell line to one perturbagen in a given dose and time following the treatment. The remaining files contain metadata about the conditions of each experiment. The manipulation of these files uses the `cmapR` package (2), and the next sections will focus on procedures to use this data. 


## Immunomodulatory genes



A summarization of genes associated with immune modulation of cancer is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aqOXYsU1ubkbxIZI_5p8ZRootgOAT0KweMA3LvSZ7HY/). This table was elaborated by the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PanImmune Group.

Not all genes listed as cancer immunomodulators were measured by the Connectivity Map project. The subset of 65 immunomodulatory genes present in the dataset is stored in the file `data/tcga_at_cmap.csv` and this group of genes will be used for the analysis in this notebook. 


## Triple Negative Breast Cancer cell lines



This use case will focus on the 65 immunomodulator genes measured or inferred in the Connectivity Map dataset, and in the experiments involving drugs and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. 

The classification of TNBC is based on the status of three receptors frequently used in breast cancer categorization: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epithelial receptor 2 (HER2). As the name suggests, a triple negative breast cancer cell has a negative status for these three markers. (3) This subtype of breast cancer poses several challenges for treatment and there is research showing that immune modulation can influence the prognosis of the treatment.(4) 

There are four TNBC cell lines in CMap: BT20, HS578T, MCF10A, and MDAMB231. The choice of this group of cell lines is based on the assumption that a group of cell lines with shared characteristics can yield more generalizable information, avoiding biases that might be related to one particular cell line.

# 2. Data manipulation

As a first step, let's upload the data.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
#loads all metadata and drugs annotation into memory
#User needs to set the path for the CMap files by running 'export CMAP_HOME=path/to/files'
#Other alternative is to use use the following line of code to set the files path for this session. 
Sys.setenv(CMAP_HOME="/Volumes/CancerRegulome14/users/gqin/CMap/PhI_GSE92742")
source("load_data.R")
```
Besides the Connectivity Map data, this script also loaded files stored in the `data` folder. Their description and names in this session are: 

- `pcl_custom` : list of annotation of Pertubagen Classes (PCLs), i.e., classes that can be used to group drugs, such as shared mechanism of actions. More information on PCLs and how to include annotation in this table is provided in a subsequent section.

- `pcl_tidy` : list of annotation of Pertubagen Classes (PCLs) as published by Subramanian et al (1).

- `tcga_genes` : list of immunomodulator genes that are present in the Connectivity Map dataset. This dataframe also includes the annotation of these genes, in terms of classification and functions in Immune Response.


Functions for data manipulation and generation of plots are stored in separated scripts. Let's upload them now:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
#Functions for querying level 5 data and computing up and down modulation
source("gene_modulation.R")
#Functions for generating specific plots
source("cp_plots_pert.R")
#Functions for statistical tests between controls and treatments
source("cp_hypothesis_tests.R")
```


## 2.1. Querying the data and classifying up and down modulation

The Connectivity Map dataset contains data of gene expression level for controls, i.e., cell lines that were not treated with any compound. In this case, a control experiment consisted in exposing the cell line to either water, DMSO or no treatment at all. For more information about the controls in the Cmap dataset, refer to the question ["What are the perturbagen types and controls in the CMap dataset?" at the Connectopedia](https://clue.io/connectopedia/perturbagen_types_and_controls). 


The gene expression data for the controls is used for the classification if a treatment is up or down-modulating the expression of a gene. The file `cp_subset_controls.R` outputs the dataframes `list_ctl` and `sigs` and contains functions to manipulate the controls.  

`list_ctl` contains the identification of all experiments in CMap that are controls for perturbations with compounds. 

`sigs` is a dataframe with all experiments with **compounds** that have **3 or more replicates**.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
source("cp_subset_controls.R") #returns list of controls, contains functions to calculate threshold and returns "sig", the list of signatures with compounds and 3 or more replicates
```


The list of controls is organized as follows:
```{r}
head(list_ctl) 
```
The dataframe `list_ctl` contains information on the identification of the experiment performed (`sig_id`) and the associated identification of the perturbagen (`pert_iname`), cell line (`cell_id`) and its primary site and type, and the duration of the treatment (`pert_time`).


With the data of the controls, we can compute if genes are up or down modulated by drugs. This is done by comparing the gene expression value of a gene under treatment with the gene expression data for the controls. The function `get_z_list` computes the mean of z-scores that separates the 1% and 99% of z-scores of expression of the controls across all genes measured. In this case, we will compute the threshold of modulation for 4 cell lines: "BT20", "MCF10A", "MDAMB231", "HS578T" - all of them are classified as Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells.

```{r, message=FALSE}
#Computing the threshold of "modulating z-score for a cell line". One can search using the cell line name, or a tissue of origin. Set to "FALSE" the variable that is not going to be used. Set list_cells = "all" to collect data of all cell lines (that have a control, and for experiments with more than 3 replicates)
cell_lines <- c("BT20", "MCF10A", "MDAMB231", "HS578T")

z_control <- get_z_list(list_cells = cell_lines, tissue = FALSE)
z_control
```

The `z_control` dataframe contains the summary statistics of z-scores that separate the 1% and 99% of z-scores of expression of the controls associated with the cell lines or tissues selected. The `mean` column have the mean of the absolute values of z-scores, and this value will be used as a threshold for determining if the z-score associated of a gene in a given treatment is considered up or down modulated.  

To compute this, the function ```get_modsigs_per_cellid``` takes as arguments the control threshold of modulation (`control_stats`), the list of genes of interest (`list_genes`) and the list of signatures of interest (`signatures`).

In this notebook, the list of genes of our interest is stored in the dataframe `tcga_genes`, uploaded with the `load_data.R` script and stored in the `data` folder. This dataframe lists genes with immunomodulatory activity. However, a user can enter any vector of genes (using their *Entrez ID* number) of interest.

The list of signatures used here, `sigs`, includes all perturbations with compounds and have 3 or more replicates.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#Using the threshold to classify the expression of all perturbations in a given cell line
mod_df <- get_modsigs_per_cellid(controls_stats = z_control, list_genes = tcga_genes[,1], signatures = sigs)

head(mod_df)
```

The `mod_df` object lists all signatures (`sig_id`) that are related to the cell lines of interest and contains the z-score for each of the immunomodulatory genes (`pr_gene_id`), including the annotation if this signature has this gene up or down-modulated.

## 2.2. Adding annotation of compounds - PCL

It may be of interest to analyze the results obtained at `mod_df` in terms if drugs with similarities (mechanism of action, application, chemical structure, etc) have similar patterns of up and down modulation.

The CMap dataset already designated a classification of the perturbations, called **Perturbagen Classes (PCL)**. Definition of the PCL class, according to the team that created the Connectivity Map dataset, can be described as follows:

> Compound PCLs are identified by first grouping compounds that share the same mechanism of action (MoA) or biological functions as determined from the literature. Then (...) existing data [is] analyzed for these groupings to assess whether the members give similar gene expression signatures, thus confirming their shared activity. 
 
More information on PCL is available at [What are Perturbagen Classes (PCLs)?](https://clue.io/connectopedia/pcls)

The PCL classification developed by the CMap team is stored in this session in the `pcl_tidy` object. 

However, one may want to add more annotations of compounds, and even include different criteria of classification (e.g., drugs with different MoA but used for the same type of treatment). To allow the inclusion of more annotation of drugs, there are two different strategies: add one annotation at a time (with the function `add_annot`), or upload a .csv file with all annotations desired. Both approaches will be described in detail next.

Regardless of the alternative chosen, the information required for a new annotation of a drug, in order, is as follows:

- **pert_id**: `pert_id` is the identifier used at CMap to uniquely address a particular compound. A same compound can have more than one `pert_id`, due to differences of information between vendors. Example:"BRD-K85606544". For more information about BRD ID, refer to [What is a BRD ID?](https://clue.io/connectopedia/what_is_a_brd_id) and [Why do some perturbagens have more than one BRD ID?](https://clue.io/connectopedia/some_perts_have_over_one_brdid)

- **pert_iname**: `pert_iname` is the name commonly used for the compound (may have differences with names of commercially available drugs). Special attention should be taken in this field, as this is the most commonly used for grouping of results on the level of perturbations. Example: "neratinib"

- **pcl_id**: the name of the perturbagen class. The pattern adopted by the Broad Institute for this field consists of starting with "CP_" as a way to design a compound, followed by the description of the class with words separated by underscores. Special attention should be taken in this field, as this is the most commonly used for grouping of results on the PCL level. Example: "CP_HER2_TARGET"

- **pcl_name**: similar to `pcl_id`, without any guideline to formatting. Example: "HER2 Inhibitor"    

- **pcl_type**: for compound annotation, default is "CP".     

- **pcl_source**: source of the annotation. In this example, the classification of neratinib was obtained in the Drugbank database, so this field would contain "Drugbank"   

- **pcl_criteria**: this field is flexible, as it should contain a meta annotation. For example, the annotation of neratinib as a drug that target the HER2 gene is important in the context of treatment of breast cancer. But another annotation available for this same compound is that it is an EGFR Inhibitor, and this is based on its mechanism of action. This field of annotation should be seen as a way to annotate the rationale behind the annotation, and potentially simplify data manipulation in other stages. Example: "Treatment HER2+ breast cancer"


For information of the **pert_id** and **pert_iname** available in the Connectivity Map, refer to the `pertinfo` dataframe.



### a. Adding one annotation at a time

The function `add_annot` is used for the inclusion of one annotation at a time, and it takes as first argument an existing dataframe with PCL annotation, and the other arguments are the required fields for a new drug annotation.
We have uploaded the "pclsCustom.csv" file as the `pcl_custom` dataframe, and we will use it as the initial annotation dataframe. Any annotation included with this funtion is automatically saved in the "pclsCustom.csv" file, so it only needs to be uploaded once.
```{r}
#Adding one annotation at the time - It is saved in the "pclsCustom.csv" file, so it only needs to be uploaded once

# pcl_custom <- add_annot(pcl_custom, pert_id ="BRD-K85606544", pert_iname = "neratinib", pcl_id = "CP_HER2_TARGET", pcl_name = "HER2 Inhibitor", pcl_type = "CP", pcl_source = "Drugbank", pcl_criteria = "Treatment HER2+ breast cancer")
# pcl_custom <- add_annot(pcl_custom, pert_id ="BRD-K19687926", pert_iname = "lapatinib", pcl_id = "CP_HER2_TARGET", pcl_name = "HER2 Antagonist", pcl_type = "CP", pcl_source = "Drugbank",pcl_criteria = "Treatment HER2+ breast cancer")
# pcl_custom <- add_annot(pcl_custom, pert_id ="BRD-M07438658", pert_iname = "lapatinib", pcl_id = "CP_HER2_TARGET", pcl_name = "HER2 Antagonist", pcl_type = "CP", pcl_source = "Drugbank", pcl_criteria = "Treatment HER2+ breast cancer")
```


### b. Uploading a file with extra annotations

Another option involves uploading a csv file with new annotations. Note that this file should have all annotation parameters named and ordered as described above. 
```{r}
new_annots <- read.csv("data/newannot.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#including the pert_id information
ids <- pertinfo %>% select(pert_id, pert_iname)
new_annots <- merge(new_annots, ids, by = "pert_iname")
```

```{r}
pcl_custom <- rbind(pcl_custom, new_annots)
```

This approach of adding annotation is **_not_** automatically saved in the "pclsCustom.csv" file. In this case, the `newannot.csv` file should be kept in case the annotation will be used in the future.


# 3. Use cases 

Now that all data and functions are loaded, let's see some use cases of how the Connectivity Map dataset can be used to analyze the cancer immunomodulator genes (summarized in the `tcga_genes` dataframe) expression levels after treatment with compounds.

The dataframe `mod_df`, created in **Querying and classifying up and down modulation** section with the `get_modsigs_per_cellid()` function, is in the format taken by all these functions. Besides this, in most of the cases the user is supposed to choose the name of the drug (all options are available in the `sigs` dataframe) or a group of drugs by their `pcl_id` in the `pcl_custom` dataframe. Note that cell lines were not treated with all drugs used in the Connectivity Map data collection. In the case of the TNBC cell lines, they were treated with only 176 drugs:

```{r}
sigs %>% 
  dplyr::filter(cell_id %in% c("BT20", "MCF10A", "MDAMB231", "HS578T")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(pert_iname) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  head()
```

As mentioned previously, the annotation of these drugs can be adjusted according to the goals of analysis.

The genes available to query are summarized below:
```{r}
levels(tcga_genes$pr_gene_symbol)
```


## 3.1. Use Case 1: List of perturbations that generate the highest absolute mean of z-scores for a selected gene

In case an user is interested in a particular immunomodulatory gene and wants to know which drugs are expected to have a strong effect in changing the expression levels of this gene, a straightforward strategy is to compute the summary statistics of all experiments of a given drug. Summary statistics, such as the mean, can be used as a criteria to select drugs with highest values.

The function `get_top_pert_pergene` takes the `mod_df` dataframe and the gene of interest and returns the list with the drug and cell line combinations that have the highest values of a selected statistics, set by the `stats_selector` parameter, with the default of arranging by mean.

In this example, we will take a look on the CTLA4 gene.
```{r}
#select the gene of interest
gene <- "CTLA4"
```

If there is a list of drugs to use in this analysis, it can be informed with the `pert_list` parameter. The default is `pert_list = "all"` , which computes the summary statistics for all drugs available in the `mod_df` dataframe. You can also select if you want to see the results of all combinations of drug treatment and cell lines `by_cell = TRUE`), or only drug treatment (`by_cell = FALSE`) The number of rows in the output can be set with the `n_pert` parameter.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#available stats_selector to select from are: "mean", "sd", "p0", "p25", "p50", "p75", "p100" - where p denotes the quantile

top_pert <- get_top_pert_pergene(mod_df, gene_symbol = gene, pert_list = "all", stats_selector = "mean", by_cell = FALSE, n_pert = 20)
top_pert
```

In this example, the drug CGP-60474 yields the highest value of mean of z-score value for the CTLA4 gene across all the 24 experiments with this drug and the 4 TNBC cell lines.

In case there is interest in segregating these results by each cell line and drug teatment combination, setting the paramenter `by_cell` to `TRUE` provides this information. In the following example, we are also requesting to the combination that had the highest value across all experiments.
```{r, warning= FALSE}
top_pert <- get_top_pert_pergene(mod_df, gene_symbol = gene, pert_list = "all", stats_selector = "p100", by_cell = TRUE, n_pert = 10)
top_pert %>% select(pr_gene_id, cell_id, pert_iname, mean, p100)
```
 
 In this example, the CGP-60474 drug also appears as the drug in the set of experiments with the highest value of differential expression for the CTLA4 gene, especially for the MDAMB231 cell line.

## 3.2. Use Case 2: Boxplots of z-cores for a given gene across different drugs, grouped by cell lines and perturbagen classes

As a first step of visualizing the data, we can select a group of compounds or PCLs and plot the distribution of gene expression for one particular gene.

Assuming an interest of checking the effect of these drugs on the CTLA4 gene, one can visualize the standardized gene expression distribution across different drugs. Most drug and cell line combinations have more than one gene signature available in the dataset, providing enough data to observe the distribution of expression data for a given situation.

This visualization adopts a normalized and relative gene expression data, also available at the Connectivity Map dataset. As a consequence, the boxplots have a horizontal line at z-score = 0 (red dotted line), as a way to improve the comparison of the present distribution with the median of the distribution of the gene expression across all experiments in the dataset.

To start, let's select the gene and PCLs of interest. 



```{r}
#select the gene of interest (refer to pr_gene_symbol codes in tcga_genes table for other options)
gene <- "CTLA4"

#select the PCLs of interest (refer to pcl_id on pcl_custom dataframe)

pcls <- c("CP_CDK46_INHIBITOR", "CP_HER2_TARGET" , "CP_PARP_INHIBITOR" )

#Define the labels to be displayed in the final plot
pcls_label <- c(control = "Controls", CP_CDK46_INHIBITOR = "CDK4/6 Inhibitors", CP_HER2_TARGET = "Drugs targeting HER2", CP_PARP_INHIBITOR = "PARP Inhibitors", CP_HER2_TARGET = "Drugs targeting HER2")

```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
plot_z_by_pcl(gene_symbol = gene, tidy_z = mod_df, my_pcl = pcls, pcl_annot = pcl_custom, pcl_labels = pcls_label)
```

This image is also saved as a _png_ figure in the current working directory, and the name is the selected gene.

This plot shows that most of the analyzed drugs cause expression levels to disperse around the median expression of CTLA4. Besides some outliers in almost all cases, another interesting observation is the effect of olaparib on the CTLA4 gene across multiple experiments. The distribution looks shifted to the left, which may open the hypothesis that olaparib has an inhibitory effect on the CTLA4 gene. 

In case you want to generate boxplots for all immunomodulator genes for a given class of compounds:
```{r}
#genes <- as.data.frame(tcga_genes$pr_gene_symbol)

#apply(genes,1, plot_z_by_pcl, tidy_z = mod_list, my_pcl = pcls, pcl_annot = pcl_annot, pcl_labels = pcls_label)
```



## 3.3. Use Case 3: Plot the number of times that a compound up and down modulate genes, across all cell lines

One question that the visualization of the distribution of gene expression data can create is if a given compound or PCL has a up or down modulation effect in the genes. The `mod_df` dataframe already organizes if a gene is up, down or not modulated when submitted to a given treatment, but we can see if all experiments with a given drug have the same effect.

For example, let's take a closer look on the up and down modulation of drugs classified as PARP inhibitors. Olaparib and veliparib are the two drugs with this annotation that were tested against the 4 TNBC cell lines ("BT20", "MCF10A", "MDAMB231", "HS578T").

The `make_freq_mod` function takes the `mod_df` dataframe and computes the frequency that a given combination of cell line (`cell_id`), gene (`pr_gene_symbol`) and drug (`pert_iname`) is up (`n_up`) and down (`n_dn`) modulated.


```{r}
make_freq_mod(tidy_mod = mod_df, name_cp_pcl = "CP_PARP_INHIBITOR", by.pcl = TRUE, pcl_annot = pcl_custom) %>% head()
```

In this results, we can see in row 3, that across all 8 experiments (`total`) where a BT20 cell line is treated with the drug olaparib, the gene BTN3A1 is down modulated in 3 (`n_dn`), which represents 37.5% (`freq_dn`) of all experiments. On the other hand, there is only 1 experiment with up-modulation (`n_up`), which represents 12.5% (`freq_up`) of the `total`. The last column, `diff`, is the difference between frequencies, i.e., `freq_up` - `freq_dn`.

The first visualization of patterns of up and down-modualtion is to create a scatterplot with up-modulation x down-modulation. This table has data segregated in cell lines, but we will group them all together to analyze the 4 cell lines as a group. In addition, since we are interested in the behavior of the class of drugs, the data for the two drugs will also be merged. The function `plot_count_mod()` takes care of the manipulation of data and outputs a scatterplot of the number of signatures associated with a drug or PCL that are upmodulating a given gene, including labels for extremes.
  

```{r, warning= FALSE}
#The number of experiments across different cell lines and compounds may differ. You can adjust the x and y axis with the 'x_scale' and 'y_scale' parameters. The threshold for labelling points in the x and y axis are, respectively, 'x_label' and 'y_label'.

plot_count_mod(mod_df, name_cp_pcl = "CP_PARP_INHIBITOR", by.pcl = TRUE, pcl_annot = pcl_custom, x_scale = c(0,25), y_scale = c(0,40), x_label = 15, y_label = 19)
```

In this plot, we can see if a compound (or a class of compounds) has a more strong effect in up or down modulation across different genes - for example, the gene TLR4 has more cases of up-modulation (17) than down-modulation (2) in all experiments of the PARP Inhibitors in TNBC cell lines. This plot also includes the annotation of Immune Checkpoint of the genes - for example, the TLR4 gene has a stimulatory effect on the immune system. The "NA" Immune Checkpoint label refers to genes with not established annotation to their 

In addition, one can create a plot based on a single compound. The name of the compound should be informed in the `name_cp_pcl` argument, and the `by.pcl` argument should be set to `FALSE`. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
plot_count_mod(mod_df, name_cp_pcl = "olaparib", by.pcl = FALSE, pcl_annot = pcl_custom, x_scale = c(0,10), y_scale = c(0,20), x_label = 5, y_label = 12)
```


## 3.4. Use Case 4: Plot heatmap of differential expression 

The previous use case is not very scalable to show more than one drug or PCL. To increase the visualization of the effect of more than one drug on all cancer immunomodulatory genes, one can use the function `plot_heatmap_mod`. This function plots a heatmap with the difference of frequency of up modulation and down modulation of a gene submitted to a drug treatment. The rows (drugs) and columns (genes) are hierarchically clustered to highlight eventual patterns. In addition, the drugs have an annotation of their mechanism of action (when available), and the genes have the annotation of their immune checkpoint (either inhibitory or stimulatory) and their category of activity in the immune response.


```{r}
plot_heatmap_mod(tidy_mod = mod_df, name_cp_pcl = c("CP_PARP_INHIBITOR"), by.pcl = TRUE, by.cell = FALSE, pcl_annot = pcl_custom, filename = "heatmap.png", width = 15)
```

For an improved visualization, this plot is also saved as a _.png_ file in the current working directory (this can be changed in the 'filename' parameter).
In this case, we can see that olaparib and veliparib, despite being both PARP inhibitors, have an overall different pattern of modulation of the immunomodulator genes. 


## 3.5. Use Case 5: Comparing gene expression data between treatment and controls

The use of statistical methods to compare treatment and controls gene expression data can provide an alternative way of analyzing the combination of available drugs and immunomodulatory genes in the dataset.

Functions related with this use case are available at the `cp_hypothesis_tests.R` script. Here we are going to use the `test_all` function. To use this function, we will need to collect a few more data:

```{r, message=FALSE}
#augmenting the information in the `mod_df` table, with data from the perturbations used
mod_df_full <- make_full_table(mod_df)

#the z-score gene expression of the controls will also need to be provided in tidy format
ctl_z <- get_zscores(tcga_genes[,1], list_ctl[list_ctl$cell_id %in% cell_lines,1])
```
We will use these two dataframes as input for the `test_all` function. The `mod_df_full` dataframe contains the z-scores for each immunomodulatory gene across several drugs. The `ctl_z` dataframe contains the data of z-scores for each immunomodulatory gene in the control signatures. With this data, we can compute the Welch's t-test statistics comparing expression of genes of interest between experimental/perturbation groups and controls.

Here we are going to analyze all genes present in the `tcga_genes` dataframe. However, it is possible to subset the analysis by setting the `gene_list` argument to the desired genes.

```{r, include=FALSE}
ttests <- test_all(gene_list = tcga_genes[,1], mod_df = mod_df_full, ctl_df = ctl_z)
```

The resulting dataframe should contain a row for each combination of drug (`pert_iname`) and gene. Just as a sanity check, let's confirm if this happened:
```{r}
nrow(tcga_genes)*length(unique(mod_df_full$pert_iname))
nrow(ttests)
```

Let's take a look on the dataframe with the results of the tests.
```{r}
head(ttests)

In this small sample of results, we can see that the gene HMGB1 (`pr_gene_id = 3146`) has a significant, if we consider p-value < 0.05, lower mean of differential expression when treated with WYE-125132 when compared with the differential expression of this gene in control experiments.

We can also plot the results of these tests with a heatmap reporting the common logarithm of the p-value of the two-sample Welchâ€™s t-test, adjusting the sign in a way that up modulation has a positive value (red color) and down modulation of a gene has a negative value (blue color). 
Besides this adaptation, the function to plot heatmaps needs a wide table. The function `ph_wide` takes the `ttests` dataframe and organizes it in the required format for plotting. 
```{r}
ph_wide <- test_wide(ttests)
ph_wide[1:5, 1:5]
```

In the first row of this table, we can see that the absolute log10 of the p-value of the test of the drug A-443644 is 0.5447. The positive sign indicates that the sign of change was positive - in other words, the mean of expression of ARG1 gene when treated with A-443644 is higher than the control's. Also, if you want to compute the p-value of a given combination of gene and drug, you just need to use the negative of the value in each cell as the exponent of 10. For example:

- ARG1 and A-443644: p-value = 10^(-0.5447027) = 0.2852971

- ARG1 and ABT-737: p-value = 10^(-1.642784) = 0.02276229

Now that we have the data in the adequate format, we can plot a heatmap, using the function `plot_heatmap_test`. For an improved visualization, this function also saves the heatmap as a __png__ file, in the location and name set by the `filename` parameter. You can also change the size of the file by changing the `height` and `width` parameters. Both rows (drugs) and columns (genes) are hierarchically clustered, and the distance criteria for clustering can be set with the `clustering_distance_rows` and `clustering_distance_cols` - the options are "euclidean", "correlation" and other supported by dist (type ?dist in the R console for more information).

```{r}
plot_heatmap_test(ttests, ph_wide, clustering_distance_rows = "correlation",
  clustering_distance_cols = "correlation", filename = "heatmap.png", height = 25, width = 15)
```



Annotation of the mechanism of action (when available) of drugs is included, as well as the annotation of gene immune checkpoint (either inhibitory or stimulatory) and the category of activity in the immune response.
Not only does this method allow for a through visualization of several combinations of experiments, but also supports the use of different statistical methods for comparison of two samples and the filter based on p-values and/or distinct parameters of experiments.
